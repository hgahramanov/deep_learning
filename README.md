# deep_learning

Hello! This is my C++ implementation of matrix, matrix-related operations and neural networks. 

So far only matrices are implemented. The standard datatype used for matrices is double.
So far I dont see the need to include support for other dataypes. This might change depending on whether I will add further GPU-specific optimization.
deepl::Matrix includes matrix multiplication, transpose and addition. I also plan to add Nvidia GPU parallelization for matrix operations.

Everything is defined within the namespace deepl.
